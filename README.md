# Proton Authenticator - Airgapped Edition

This repository contains a modified version of the Proton Authenticator Android application, specifically adapted for **airgapped (network-isolated) environments**.

## üîí Airgapped Modifications

This version has been modified by **multiply.a1** in collaboration with **Rovo Dev AI** to create a fully offline, network-isolated authenticator. The following changes have been implemented:

### üö´ Network Isolation
- **Internet permission removed** from AndroidManifest.xml
- **Sync functionality disabled** - No cloud synchronization with Proton servers
- **All network-dependent features removed** for complete offline operation

### üé® UI Modifications
- **"Discover Proton" section removed** - Eliminated all promotional content for other Proton services (Pass, VPN, Mail, Calendar, Drive)
- **Sync toggle removed** from Security settings
- **Version identifier updated** - Now displays "-airgapped" suffix to clearly indicate this is a network-isolated build

### üéØ Purpose
This airgapped version is designed for:
- High-security environments requiring network isolation
- Offline-only TOTP/2FA code generation
- Users who prefer complete privacy without any network communication
- Environments where internet access is restricted or prohibited

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **No online backup/restore functionality** - All data remains local only
- **No account synchronization** - Codes must be manually added to each device
- **No automatic updates** - Manual installation required for updates
- **Local storage only** - All authenticator entries are stored locally on the device
